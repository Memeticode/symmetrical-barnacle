Is it possible to remover the render button? Image reloads when user changes something, title and alt text also reload? Is this too slow for the animation?

Idea is that we definetly want images to update in real-time in response to user change in config. Not sure if the same is feasible with animation.


Add animation time slider bar above animation. (occupies space remaining from validation). probably add play/pause butons too.


Apply fancy loading icon to whole page while menus load, then do render animation.
