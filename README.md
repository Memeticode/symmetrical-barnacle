# Geometric Interior

**Geometric Interior** is a study in structured emergence — a digital space where geometry, constraint, and instability interact to produce living form.

The project explores how hidden mathematical frameworks can shape perception without announcing themselves. Crystalline logic meets organic variation. Precision bends toward motion. Symmetry is allowed, but never trusted entirely.

Rather than layering complexity, the work seeks tension within minimal systems:
- Structure without rigidity  
- Instability without chaos  
- Geometry that feels inhabited  

Each iteration refines the relationship between constraint and expression. Forms evolve not through ornament, but through alignment, distortion, and internal pressure.

Geometric Interior is not a gallery of images.  
It is an investigation into how space can be felt.
