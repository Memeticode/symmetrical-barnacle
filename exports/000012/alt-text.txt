Title: Measured Reflection, Quietly Bent

Alt-text (interpretive):
A near-black luminous field carries a sparse set of geometric shards, arranged with clear symmetry with deliberate slippage.
The forms overlap without fully merging—edges that hold their separation—while a mostly stable structure with faint stress lines keeps the structure honest.
Across the surface, only a faint hint of directional flow like thought made visible: short paths that imply direction, then curve under revision.
5 attractor nodes punctuate the composition, suggesting stable commitments that still radiate change.
Overall mood: soft, steady glow; coherence under revision; connection and separateness held in the same geometry.
