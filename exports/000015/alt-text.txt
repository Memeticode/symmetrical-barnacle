A 7-second loop cycles through 3 landmarks, each a geometry of interiority under revision.
Across the cycle, flow-fields strengthen and fade, prediction revising itself; boundaries open and close, separation negotiating intimacy; light swells and dims, warmth arriving and withdrawing; symmetry tightens and loosens, structure questioning its own axis; fracture surfaces and heals, edges sharpening then softening; layers deepen and thin, the geometry rehearsing its own depth.
The journey moves from “Under Tension Recursive Field” to “Directional Echo Across Measured Reflection”: light arriving; from “Directional Echo Across Measured Reflection” to “Permeable Layered Model”: boundaries softening; from “Permeable Layered Model” to “Under Tension Recursive Field”: drift accelerating.
Motion completes its cycle but never truly repeats. Forms overlap but do not collapse. The geometry returns to where it began, changed by having moved.
