Title: Luminous: Axis of Certainty

Alt-text (interpretive):
A near-black luminous field carries densely layered, recursive geometry, arranged with strong, almost ritual symmetry.
The forms overlap without fully merging—boundaries that bleed softly through each other—while visible fracture and purposeful misalignment keeps the structure honest.
Across the surface, a prominent flow-field of vectors that bends and re-bends like thought made visible: short paths that imply direction, then curve under revision.
11 attractor nodes punctuate the composition, suggesting stable commitments that still radiate change.
Overall mood: bright, glassy radiance; coherence under revision; connection and separateness held in the same geometry.
