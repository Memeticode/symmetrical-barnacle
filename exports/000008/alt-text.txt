Title: Quietly Bent Sparse Geometry

Alt-text (interpretive):
A near-black luminous field carries a sparse set of geometric shards, arranged with strong, almost ritual symmetry.
The forms overlap without fully merging—semi-permeable edges where overlaps accumulate—while a mostly stable structure with faint stress lines keeps the structure honest.
Across the surface, only a faint hint of directional flow like thought made visible: short paths that imply direction, then curve under revision.
4 attractor nodes punctuate the composition, suggesting stable commitments that still radiate change.
Overall mood: bright, glassy radiance; coherence under revision; connection and separateness held in the same geometry.
