Title: Dark Coherence: Unstable Mirror

Alt-text (interpretive):
A near-black luminous field carries a sparse set of geometric shards, arranged with loose symmetry, more suggestion than rule.
The forms overlap without fully merging—semi-permeable edges where overlaps accumulate—while visible fracture and purposeful misalignment keeps the structure honest.
Across the surface, a prominent flow-field of vectors that bends and re-bends like thought made visible: short paths that imply direction, then curve under revision.
6 attractor nodes punctuate the composition, suggesting stable commitments that still radiate change.
Overall mood: low-light coherence; coherence under revision; connection and separateness held in the same geometry.
