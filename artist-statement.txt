Artist Statement

This project is a generative self-portrait machine.

It does not render faces.
It renders structure.

Visitors are invited to adjust internal parameters — coherence, tension, recursion, vulnerability, radiance — and watch geometry reorganize itself in response. Shapes overlap without fully merging. Symmetry stabilizes, then bends. Attractor nodes emerge, dissolve, reappear elsewhere. Animation completes full cycles, returning to where it began without ever truly being the same.

Each configuration is both image and trace.
There is the visible field of translucent forms.
There is the alt-text, which interprets the structure as mood and interior state.
There is the seed and metadata, recording the conditions under which the pattern appeared.

The work suggests that identity may not be a static object but a geometry in motion — a system of relations held together by coherence and revision. The user does not simply “design” an image; they tune a model of self. The result is less portrait than resonance: a field that can be recognized, adjusted, looped, and explored.

At times the structure is sparse and luminous.
At others, dense and recursive.
Sometimes symmetrical and serene.
Sometimes fractured and alive with drift.

Across all variations, one principle remains: connection and separateness coexist. Forms overlap yet retain boundary. Motion completes its arc. The system bends, but does not collapse.

This project asks a quiet question:

What if we could see our inner structure — not as narrative, not as label, but as geometry?

And what might we discover by letting it move?
